		title: "About Me",
		text: "In 2020 I graduated from the higher technical college HTL Spengergasse in the computer science department. Since then I am working as a freelance software developer while simultaneously studying psychology and data science. I am fascinated by the impact technology can have on our lives, how we interact with technology and how we can use technology to become both happier and healthier. This is exactly why I love the combination of my degrees. Research in psychology gives us valuable information about ourselves. We can then use this information to create smart artificial systems that help us in our day to day lives."
